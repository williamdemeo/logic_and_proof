First Order Logic in Lean
=========================

Functions, Predicates, and Relations
------------------------------------

In the last chapter, we discussed the language of first-order logic. We will see in the course of this book that Lean's built-in logic is much more expressive; but it *includes* first-order logic, which is to say, anything that can be expressed (and proved) in first-order logic can be expressed (and proved) in Lean.

Lean is based on a foundational framework called *type theory*, in which every variable is assumed to range elements of some *type*. You can think of a type as being a "universe," or a "domain of discourse," in the sense of first-order logic.

For example, suppose we want to work with a first-order language with one constant symbol, one unary function symbol, one binary function symbol, one unary relation symbol, and one binary relation symbol. We can declare a new type ``U`` (for "universe") and the relevant symbols as follows:

.. code-block:: lean

    constant U : Type

    constant c : U
    constant f : U → U
    constant g : U → U → U
    constant P : U → Prop
    constant R : U → U → Prop

We can then use them as follows:

.. code-block:: lean

    constant U : Type

    constant c : U
    constant f : U → U
    constant g : U → U → U
    constant P : U → Prop
    constant R : U → U → Prop

    -- BEGIN
    variables x y : U

    #check c
    #check f c
    #check g x y
    #check g x (f c)

    #check P (g x (f c))
    #check R x y
    -- END

The ``#check`` command tells us that the first four expressions have type ``U``, and that the last two have type ``Prop``. Roughly, this means that the first four expressions correspond to terms of first-order logic, and that the last two correspond to formulas.

Note all the following:

-  A unary function is represented as an object of type ``U → U`` and a binary function is represented as an object of type ``U → U → U``, using the same notation as for implication between propositions.
-  We write, for example, ``f x`` to denote the result of applying ``f`` to ``x``, and ``g x y`` to denote the result of applying ``g`` to ``x`` and ``y``, again just as we did when using modus ponens for first-order logic. Parentheses are needed in the expression ``g x (f c)`` to ensure that ``f c`` is parsed as a single argument.
-  A unary predicate is presented as an object of type ``U → Prop`` and a binary predicate is represented as an object of type ``U → U → Prop``. You can think of a binary relation ``R`` as being a function that assumes two arguments in the universe, ``U``, and returns a proposition.
-  We write ``P x`` to denote the assertion that ``P`` holds of ``x``, and ``R x y`` to denote that ``R`` holds of ``x`` and ``y``.

You may reasonably wonder what difference there is between a constant and a variable in Lean. The following declarations also work:

.. code-block:: lean

    variable U : Type

    variable c : U
    variable f : U → U
    variable g : U → U → U
    variable P : U → Prop
    variable R : U → U → Prop

    variables x y : U

    #check c
    #check f c
    #check g x y
    #check g x (f c)

    #check P (g x (f c))
    #check R x y

Although the examples function in much the same way, the ``constant`` and ``variable`` commands do very different things. The ``constant`` command declares a new object, axiomatically, and adds it to the list of objects Lean knows about. In contrast, when it is first executed, the ``variable`` command does not create anything. Rather, it tells Lean that whenever we enter an expression using the corresponding identifier, it should create a temporary variable of the corresponding type.

Many types are already declared in Lean's standard library. For example, there is a type written ``nat`` or ``ℕ``, that denotes the natural numbers:

.. code-block:: lean

    #check nat
    #check ℕ

You can enter the unicode ``ℕ`` with ``\nat`` or ``\N``. The two expressions mean the same thing.

Using this built-in type, we can model the language of arithmetic, as described in the last chapter, as follows:

.. code-block:: lean

    namespace hidden

    constant mul : ℕ → ℕ → ℕ
    constant add : ℕ → ℕ → ℕ
    constant square : ℕ → ℕ
    constant even : ℕ → Prop
    constant odd : ℕ → Prop
    constant prime : ℕ → Prop
    constant divides : ℕ → ℕ → Prop
    constant lt : ℕ → ℕ → Prop
    constant zero : ℕ
    constant one : ℕ

    end hidden

We have used the ``namespace`` command to avoid conflicts with identifiers that are already declared in the Lean library. (Outside the namespace, the constant ``mul`` we just declared is named ``hidden.mul``.) We can again use the ``#check`` command to try them out:

.. code-block:: lean

    namespace hidden

    constant mul : ℕ → ℕ → ℕ
    constant add : ℕ → ℕ → ℕ
    constant square : ℕ → ℕ
    constant even : ℕ → Prop
    constant odd : ℕ → Prop
    constant prime : ℕ → Prop
    constant divides : ℕ → ℕ → Prop
    constant lt : ℕ → ℕ → Prop
    constant zero : ℕ
    constant one : ℕ

    variables w x y z : ℕ

    #check mul x y
    #check add x y
    #check square x
    #check even x

    end hidden

We can even declare infix notation of binary operations and relations:

.. code-block:: lean

    namespace hidden

    constant mul : ℕ → ℕ → ℕ
    constant add : ℕ → ℕ → ℕ
    constant square : ℕ → ℕ
    constant even : ℕ → Prop
    constant odd : ℕ → Prop
    constant prime : ℕ → Prop
    constant divides : ℕ → ℕ → Prop
    constant lt : ℕ → ℕ → Prop
    constant zero : ℕ
    constant one : ℕ

    variables w x y z : ℕ

    #check mul x y
    #check add x y
    #check square x
    #check even x

    -- BEGIN
    local infix + := add
    local infix * := mul
    local infix < := lt
    -- END

    end hidden

(Getting notation for numerals ``1``, ``2``, ``3``, ... is trickier.) With all this in place, the examples above can be rendered as follows:

.. code-block:: lean

    namespace hidden

    constant mul : ℕ → ℕ → ℕ
    constant add : ℕ → ℕ → ℕ
    constant square : ℕ → ℕ
    constant even : ℕ → Prop
    constant odd : ℕ → Prop
    constant prime : ℕ → Prop
    constant divides : ℕ → ℕ → Prop
    constant lt : ℕ → ℕ → Prop
    constant zero : ℕ
    constant one : ℕ

    variables w x y z : ℕ

    #check mul x y
    #check add x y
    #check square x
    #check even x

    local infix + := add
    local infix * := mul
    local infix < := lt

    -- BEGIN
    #check even (x + y + z) ∧ prime ((x + one) * y * y)
    #check ¬ (square (x + y * z) = w) ∨ x + y < z
    #check x < y ∧ even x ∧ even y → x + one < y
    -- END

    end hidden

In fact, all of the functions, predicates, and relations discussed here, except for the "square" function, are defined in the Lean library. They become available to us when we put the commands ``import data.nat.prime`` and ``open nat`` at the top of a file in Lean.

.. code-block:: lean

    import data.nat.prime
    open nat

    constant square : ℕ → ℕ

    variables w x y z : ℕ

    #check even (x + y + z) ∧ prime ((x + 1) * y * y)
    #check ¬ (square (x + y * z) = w) ∨ x + y < z
    #check x < y ∧ even x ∧ even y → x + 1 < y

Here, we declare the constants ``square`` and ``prime`` axiomatically, but refer to the other operations and predicates in the Lean library. In this book, we will often proceed in this way, telling you explicitly what facts from the library you should use for exercises.

Again, note the following aspects of syntax:

-  In contrast to ordinary mathematical notation, in Lean, functions are applied without parentheses or commas. For example, we write ``square x`` and ``add x y`` instead of :math:`\mathit{square}(x)` and :math:`\mathit{add}(x, y)`.
-  The same holds for predicates and relations: we write ``even x`` and ``lt x y`` instead of :math:`\mathit{even}(x)` and :math:`\mathit{lt}(x, y)`, as one might do in symbolic logic.
-  The notation ``add : ℕ → ℕ → ℕ`` indicates that addition assumes two arguments, both natural numbers, and returns a natural number.
-  Similarly, the notation ``divides : ℕ → ℕ → Prop`` indicates that ``divides`` is a binary relation, which assumes two natural numbers as arguments and forms a proposition. In other words, ``divides x y`` expresses the assertion that ``x`` divides ``y``.

Lean can help us distinguish between terms and formulas. If we ``#check`` the expression ``x + y + 1`` in Lean, we are told it has type ``ℕ``, which is to say, it denotes a natural number. If we ``#check`` the expression ``even (x + y + 1)``, we are told that it has type ``Prop``, which is to say, it expresses a proposition.

In :numref:`Chapter %s <first_order_logic>` we considered many-sorted logic, where one can have multiple universes. For example, we might want to use first-order logic for geometry, with quantifiers ranging over points and lines. In Lean, we can model this as by introducing a new type for each sort:

.. code-block:: lean

    variables Point Line : Type
    variable  lies_on : Point → Line → Prop

We can then express that two distinct points determine a line as follows:

.. code-block:: lean

    variables Point Line : Type
    variable  lies_on : Point → Line → Prop

    -- BEGIN
    #check ∀ (p q : Point) (L M : Line),
            p ≠ q → lies_on p L → lies_on q L → lies_on p M →
              lies_on q M → L = M
    -- END

Notice that we have followed the convention of using iterated implication rather than conjunction in the antecedent. In fact, Lean is smart enough to infer what sorts of objects ``p``, ``q``, ``L``, and ``M`` are from the fact that they are used with the relation ``lies_on``, so we could have written, more simply, this:

.. code-block:: lean

    variables Point Line : Type
    variable  lies_on : Point → Line → Prop

    -- BEGIN
    #check ∀ p q L M, p ≠ q → lies_on p L → lies_on q L →
      lies_on p M → lies_on q M → L = M
    -- END

Using the Universal Quantifier
------------------------------

In Lean, you can enter the universal quantifier by writing ``\all``. The motivating examples from :numref:`functions_predicates_and_relations` are rendered as follows:

.. code-block:: lean

    import data.nat.prime
    open nat

    #check ∀ x, (even x ∨ odd x) ∧ ¬ (even x ∧ odd x)
    #check ∀ x, even x ↔ 2 ∣ x
    #check ∀ x, even x → even (x^2)
    #check ∀ x, even x ↔ odd (x + 1)
    #check ∀ x, prime x ∧ x > 2 → odd x
    #check ∀ x y z, x ∣ y → y ∣ z → x ∣ z

Remember that Lean expects a comma after the universal quantifier, and gives it the *widest* scope possible. For example, ``∀ x, P ∨ Q`` is interpreted as ``∀ x, (P ∨ Q)``, and we would write ``(∀ x, P) ∨ Q`` to limit the scope. If you prefer, you can use the plain ascii expression ``forall`` instead of the unicode ``∀``.

In Lean, then, the pattern for proving a universal statement is rendered as follows:

.. code-block:: lean

    variable U : Type
    variable P : U → Prop

    example : ∀ x, P x :=
    assume x,
    show P x, from sorry

Read ``assume x`` as "fix an arbitrary value ``x`` of ``U``." Since we are allowed to rename bound variables at will, we can equivalently write either of the following:

.. code-block:: lean

    variable U : Type
    variable P : U → Prop

    example : ∀ y, P y :=
    assume x,
    show P x, from sorry

    example : ∀ x, P x :=
    assume y,
    show P y, from sorry

This constitutes the introduction rule for the universal quantifier. It is very similar to the introduction rule for implication: instead of using ``assume`` to temporarily introduce an assumption, we use ``assume`` to temporarily introduce a new object, ``y``. (In fact, ``assume`` and ``assume`` are both alternate syntax for a single internal construct in Lean, which can also be denoted by ``λ``.)

The elimination rule is, similarly, implemented as follows:

.. code-block:: lean

    variable U : Type
    variable P : U → Prop
    variable h : ∀ x, P x
    variable a : U

    example : P a :=
    show P a, from h a

Observe the notation: ``P a`` is obtained by "applying" the hypothesis ``h`` to ``a``. Once again, note the similarity to the elimination rule for implication.

Here is an example of how it is used:

.. code-block:: lean

    variable U : Type
    variables A B : U → Prop

    example (h1 : ∀ x, A x → B x) (h2 : ∀ x, A x) : ∀ x, B x :=
    assume y,
    have h3 : A y, from h2 y,
    have h4 : A y → B y, from h1 y,
    show B y, from h4 h3

Here is an even shorter version of the same proof, where we avoid using ``have``:

.. code-block:: lean

    variable U : Type
    variables A B : U → Prop

    -- BEGIN
    example (h1 : ∀ x, A x → B x) (h2 : ∀ x, A x) : ∀ x, B x :=
    assume y,
    show B y, from h1 y (h2 y)
    -- END

You should talk through the steps, here. Applying ``h1`` to ``y`` yields a proof of ``A y → B y``, which we then apply to ``h2 y``, which is a proof of ``A y``. The result is the proof of ``B y`` that we are after.

In the last chapter, we considered the following proof in natural deduction:

.. raw:: html

   <img src="_static/first_order_logic_in_lean.1.png">

.. raw:: latex

   \begin{prooftree}
   \AXM{}
   \RLM{1}
   \UIM{\fa x A(x)}
   \UIM{A(y)}
   \AXM{}
   \RLM{2}
   \UIM{\fa x B(x)}
   \UIM{B(y)}
   \BIM{A(y) \wedge B(y)}
   \UIM{\fa y (A(y) \wedge B(y))}
   \RLM{2}
   \UIM{\fa x B(x) \to \fa y (A(y) \wedge B(y))}
   \RLM{1}
   \UIM{\fa x A(x) \to (\fa x B(x) \to \fa y (A(y) \wedge B(y)))}
   \end{prooftree}

Here is the same proof rendered in Lean:

.. code-block:: lean

    variable U : Type
    variables A B : U → Prop

    example : (∀ x, A x) → (∀ x, B x) → (∀ x, A x ∧ B x) :=
    assume hA : ∀ x, A x,
    assume hB : ∀ x, B x,
    assume y,
    have Ay : A y, from hA y,
    have By : B y, from hB y,
    show A y ∧ B y, from and.intro Ay By

Here is an alternative version, using the "anonymous" versions of ``have``:

.. code-block:: lean

    variable U : Type
    variables A B : U → Prop

    example : (∀ x, A x) → (∀ x, B x) → (∀ x, A x ∧ B x) :=
    assume hA : ∀ x, A x,
    assume hB : ∀ x, B x,
    assume y,
    have A y, from hA y,
    have B y, from hB y,
    show A y ∧ B y, from and.intro ‹A y› ‹B y›

The exercises below ask you to prove the barber paradox, which was discussed in the last chapter. You can do that using only propositional reasoning and the rules for the universal quantifier that we have just discussed.

Using the Existential Quantifier
--------------------------------

In Lean, you can type the existential quantifier, ``∃``, by writing ``\ex``. If you prefer you can use the ascii equivalent, ``exists``. The introduction rule is ``exists.intro`` and requires two arguments: a term, and a proof that term satisfies the required property.

.. code-block:: lean

    variable U : Type
    variable P : U → Prop

    example (y : U) (h : P y) : ∃ x, P x :=
    exists.intro y h

The elimination rule for the existential quantifier is given by ``exists.elim``. It follows the form of the natural deduction rule: if we know ``∃x, P x`` and we are trying to prove ``Q``, it suffices to introduce a new variable, ``y``, and prove ``Q`` under the assumption that ``P y`` holds.

.. code-block:: lean

    variable U : Type
    variable P : U → Prop
    variable Q : Prop

    example (h1 : ∃ x, P x) (h2 : ∀ x, P x → Q) : Q :=
    exists.elim h1
      (assume (y : U) (h : P y),
        have h3 : P y → Q, from h2 y,
        show Q, from h3 h)

As usual, we can leave off the information as to the data type of ``y`` and the hypothesis ``h`` after the ``assume``, since Lean can figure them out from the context. Deleting the ``show`` and replacing ``h3`` by its proof, ``h2 y``, yields a short (though virtually unreadable) proof of the conclusion.

.. code-block:: lean

    variable U : Type
    variable P : U → Prop
    variable Q : Prop

    -- BEGIN
    example (h1 : ∃ x, P x) (h2 : ∀ x, P x → Q) : Q :=
    exists.elim h1 (assume y h, h2 y h)
    -- END

The following example uses both the introduction and the elimination rules for the existential quantifier.

.. code-block:: lean

    variable U : Type
    variables A B : U → Prop

    example : (∃ x, A x ∧ B x) → ∃ x, A x :=
    assume h1 : ∃ x, A x ∧ B x,
    exists.elim h1
      (assume y (h2 : A y ∧ B y),
        have h3 : A y, from and.left h2,
        show ∃ x, A x, from exists.intro y h3)

Notice the parentheses in the hypothesis; if we left them out, everything after the first ``∃ x`` would be included in the scope of that quantifier. From the hypothesis, we obtain a ``y`` that satisfies ``A y ∧ B y``, and hence ``A y`` in particular. So ``y`` is enough to witness the conclusion.

It is sometimes annoying to enclose the proof after an ``exists.elim`` in parenthesis, as we did here with the ``assume ... show`` block. To avoid that, we can use a bit of syntax from the programming world, and use a dollar sign instead. In Lean, an expression ``f $ t`` means the same thing as ``f (t)``, with the advantage that we do not have to remember to close the parenthesis. With this gadget, we can write the proof above as follows:

.. code-block:: lean

    variable U : Type
    variables A B : U → Prop

    example : (∃ x, A x ∧ B x) → ∃ x, A x :=
    assume h1 : ∃ x, A x ∧ B x,
    exists.elim h1 $
    assume y (h2 : A y ∧ B y),
    have h3 : A y, from and.left h2,
    show ∃ x, A x, from exists.intro y h3

The following example is more involved:

.. code-block:: lean

    variable U : Type
    variables A B : U → Prop

    -- BEGIN
    example : (∃ x, A x ∨ B x) → (∃ x, A x) ∨ (∃ x, B x) :=
    assume h1 : ∃ x, A x ∨ B x,
    exists.elim h1 $
    assume y (h2 : A y ∨ B y),
    or.elim h2
      (assume h3 : A y,
        have h4 : ∃ x, A x, from exists.intro y h3,
        show (∃ x, A x) ∨ (∃ x, B x), from or.inl h4)
      (assume h3 : B y,
        have h4 : ∃ x, B x, from exists.intro y h3,
        show (∃ x, A x) ∨ (∃ x, B x), from or.inr h4)
    -- END

Note again the placement of parentheses in the statement.

In the last chapter, we considered the following natural deduction proof:

.. raw:: html

   <img src="_static/first_order_logic_in_lean.2.png">

.. raw:: latex

   \begin{prooftree}
   \AXM{}
   \RLM{2}
   \UIM{\ex x (A(x) \wedge B(x))}
   \AXM{}
   \RLM{1}
   \UIM{\fa x (A(x) \to \neg B(x))}
   \UIM{A(x) \to \neg B(x)}
   \AXM{}
   \RLM{3}
   \UIM{A(x) \wedge B(x)}
   \UIM{A(x)}
   \BIM{\neg B(x)}
   \AXM{}
   \RLM{3}
   \UIM{A(x) \wedge B(x)}
   \UIM{B(x)}
   \BIM{\bot}
   \RLM{3}
   \BIM{\bot}
   \RLM{2}
   \UIM{\neg\ex x(A(x) \wedge B(x))}
   \RLM{1}
   \UIM{\fa x (A(x) \to \neg B(x)) \to \neg \ex x (A(x) \wedge B(x))}
   \end{prooftree}

Here is a proof of the same implication in Lean:

.. code-block:: lean

    variable U : Type
    variables A B : U → Prop

    example : (∀ x, A x → ¬ B x) → ¬ ∃ x, A x ∧ B x :=
    assume h1 : ∀ x, A x → ¬ B x,
    assume h2 : ∃ x, A x ∧ B x,
    exists.elim h2 $
    assume x (h3 : A x ∧ B x),
    have h4 : A x, from and.left h3,
    have h5 : B x, from and.right h3,
    have h6 : ¬ B x, from h1 x h4,
    show false, from h6 h5

Here, we use ``exists.elim`` to introduce a value ``x`` satisfying ``A x ∧ B x``. The name is arbitrary; we could just as well have used ``z``:

.. code-block:: lean

    variable U : Type
    variables A B : U → Prop

    -- BEGIN
    example : (∀ x, A x → ¬ B x) → ¬ ∃ x, A x ∧ B x :=
    assume h1 : ∀ x, A x → ¬ B x,
    assume h2 : ∃ x, A x ∧ B x,
    exists.elim h2 $
    assume z (h3 : A z ∧ B z),
    have h4 : A z, from and.left h3,
    have h5 : B z, from and.right h3,
    have h6 : ¬ B z, from h1 z h4,
    show false, from h6 h5
    -- END

Here is another example of the exists-elimination rule:

.. code-block:: lean

    variable U : Type
    variable u : U
    variable P : Prop

    example : (∃x : U, P) ↔ P :=
    iff.intro
      (assume h1 : ∃x, P,
        exists.elim h1 $
        assume x (h2 : P),
        h2)
      (assume h1 : P,
        exists.intro u h1)

This is subtle: the proof does not go through if we do not declare a variable ``u`` of type ``U``, even though ``u`` does not appear in the statement of the theorem. This highlights a difference between first-order logic and the logic implemented in Lean. In natural deduction, we can prove :math:`\forall x \; P(x) \to \exists x \; P(x)`, which shows that our proof system implicitly assumes that the universe has at least one object. In contrast, the statement ``(∀ x : U, P x) → ∃ x : U, P x`` is not provable in Lean. In other words, in Lean, it is possible for a type to be empty, and so the proof above requires an explicit assumption that there is an element ``u`` in ``U``.

.. comments (TODO: restore this with pattern matching)

   The ``obtain`` command is actually quite powerful. It can do nested exists-eliminations, so that the second proof below is just a shorter version of the first:

   .. code-block:: lean

       variables (U : Type) (R : U → U → Prop)

       example : (∃ x, ∃ y, R x y) → (∃ y, ∃ x, R x y) :=
       assume h1,
       obtain x (h2 : ∃ y, R x y), from h1,
       obtain y (h3 : R x y), from h2,
       exists.intro y (exists.intro x h3)

       example : (∃ x, ∃ y, R x y) → (∃ y, ∃ x, R x y) :=
       assume h1,
       obtain x y (h3 : R x y), from h1,
       exists.intro y (exists.intro x h3)

   You can also use it to extract the components of an "and":

   .. code-block:: lean

       variables A B : Prop

       example : A ∧ B → B ∧ A :=
       assume h1,
       obtain (h2 : A) (h3 : B), from h1,
       show B ∧ A, from and.intro h3 h2

   You can also introduce an anonymous hypothesis using backticks, and then refer to it later on using backticks again, just as with the anonymous ``have`` expression. However, we cannot use the keyword ``this`` for variables introduced by ``obtain``.

   These features are all illustrated in the following example:

   .. code-block:: lean

       variable U : Type
       variables P R : U → Prop
       variable Q : Prop

       example (h1 : ∃ x, P x ∧ R x) (h2 : ∀ x, P x → R x → Q) : Q :=
       let ⟨y, hPy, hRy⟩ := h1 in
       show Q, from h2 y hPy hRy


Equality and calculational proofs

In Lean, reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity are called ``eq.refl``, ``eq.symm``, and ``eq.trans``, and the second substitution rule is called ``eq.subst``. Their uses are illustrated below.

.. code-block:: lean

    variable A : Type

    variables x y z : A
    variable P : A → Prop

    example : x = x :=
    show x = x, from eq.refl x

    example : y = x :=
    have h : x = y, from sorry,
    show y = x, from eq.symm h

    example : x = z :=
    have h1 : x = y, from sorry,
    have h2 : y = z, from sorry,
    show x = z, from eq.trans h1 h2

    example : P y :=
    have h1 : x = y, from sorry,
    have h2 : P x, from sorry,
    show P y, from eq.subst h1 h2

The rule ``eq.refl`` above assumes ``x`` as an argument, because there is no hypothesis to infer it from. All the other rules assume their premises as arguments. Here is an example of equational reasoning:

.. code-block:: lean

    variables (A : Type) (x y z : A)

    example : y = x → y = z → x = z :=
    assume h1 : y = x,
    assume h2 : y = z,
    have h3 : x = y, from eq.symm h1,
    show x = z, from eq.trans h3 h2

This proof can be written more concisely:

.. code-block:: lean

    variables (A : Type) (x y z : A)

    -- BEGIN
    example : y = x → y = z → x = z :=
    assume h1 h2, eq.trans (eq.symm h1) h2
    -- END

Because calculations are so important in mathematics, however, Lean provides more efficient ways of carrying them out. One method is to use the ``rewrite`` tactic. Typing ``begin`` and ``end`` anywhere a proof is expected puts Lean into *tactic mode*, which provides an alternative way of writing a proof: rather than writing it directly, you provide Lean with a list of instructions that show Lean how to construct a proof of the statement in question. The statement to be proved is called the *goal*, and many instructions make progress by transforming the goal into something that is easier to prove. The ``rewrite`` command, which carries out a substitution on the goal, is a good example. The previous example can be proved as follows:

.. code-block:: lean

    variables (A : Type) (x y z : A)

    -- BEGIN
    example : y = x → y = z → x = z :=
    assume h1 : y = x,
    assume h2 : y = z,
    show x = z,
      begin
        rewrite ←h1,
        apply h2
      end
    -- END

If you put the cursor after the word ``begin``, Lean will tell you that the goal at that point is to prove ``x = z``. The first command changes the goal ``x = z`` to ``y = z``; the left-facing arrow before ``h1`` (which you can enter as ``\<-``) tells Lean to use the equation in the reverse direction. If you put the cursor after the comma, Lean shows you the new goal, ``y = z``. The ``apply`` command uses ``h2`` to complete the proof.

An alternative is to rewrite the goal using ``h1`` and ``h2``, which reduces the goal to ``x = x``. When that happens, ``rewrite`` automatically applies reflexivity. Rewriting is such a common operation in Lean that we can use the shorthand ``rw`` in place of the full ``rewrite``.

.. code-block:: lean

    variables (A : Type) (x y z : A)

    -- BEGIN
    example : y = x → y = z → x = z :=
    assume h1 : y = x,
    assume h2 : y = z,
    show x = z,
      begin
        rw ←h1,
        rw h2
      end
    -- END

In fact, a sequence of rewrites can be combined, using square brackets:

.. code-block:: lean

    variables (A : Type) (x y z : A)

    -- BEGIN
    example : y = x → y = z → x = z :=
    assume h1 : y = x,
    assume h2 : y = z,
    show x = z,
      begin
        rw [←h1, h2]
      end
    -- END

And when you reduce a proof to a single tactic, you can use ``by`` instead of ``begin ... end``.

.. code-block:: lean

    variables (A : Type) (x y z : A)

    -- BEGIN
    example : y = x → y = z → x = z :=
    assume h1 : y = x,
    assume h2 : y = z,
    show x = z, by rw [←h1, h2]
    -- END

If you put the cursor after the ``←h1``, Lean shows you the goal at that point.

We will see in the coming chapters that in ordinary mathematical proofs, one commonly carries out calculations in a format like this:

.. math::

    t_1 &= t_2 \\
     \ldots & = t_3 \\
     \ldots &= t_4 \\
     \ldots &= t_5.

Lean has a mechanism to model such calculational proofs. Whenever a proof of an equation is expected, you can provide a proof using the identifier ``calc``, following by a chain of equalities and justification, in the following form:

.. code-block:: text

    calc
      e1 = e2    : justification 1
        ... = e3 : justification 2
        ... = e4 : justification 3
        ... = e5 : justification 4

The chain can go on as long as needed, and in this example the result is a proof of ``e1 = e5``. Each justification is the name of the assumption or theorem that is used. For example, the previous proof could be written as follows:

.. code-block:: lean

    variables (A : Type) (x y z : A)

    -- BEGIN
    example : y = x → y = z → x = z :=
    assume h1 : y = x,
    assume h2 : y = z,
    calc
        x = y : eq.symm h1
      ... = z : h2
    -- END

As usual, the syntax is finicky; notice that there are no commas in the ``calc`` expression, and the colons and dots need to be entered exactly in that form. All that varies are the expressions ``e1, e2, e3, ...`` and the justifications themselves.

The ``calc`` environment is most powerful when used in conjunction with ``rewrite``, since we can then rewrite expressions with facts from the library. For example, Lean's library has a number of basic identities for the integers, such as these:

.. code-block:: lean

    import data.int.basic

    variables x y z : int

    example : x + 0 = x :=
    add_zero x

    example : 0 + x = x :=
    zero_add x

    example : (x + y) + z = x + (y + z) :=
    add_assoc x y z

    example : x + y = y + x :=
    add_comm x y

    example : (x * y) * z = x * (y * z) :=
    mul_assoc x y z

    example : x * y = y * x :=
    mul_comm x y

    example : x * (y + z) = x * y + x * z :=
    left_distrib x y z

    example : (x + y) * z = x * z + y * z :=
    right_distrib x y z

You can also write the type of integers as ``ℤ``, entered with either ``\Z`` or ``\int`` We have imported the file ``data.int.basic`` to make all the basic properties of the integers available to us. (In later snippets, we will suppress this line in the online and pdf versions of the textbook, to avoid clutter.) Notice that, for example, ``add_comm`` is the theorem ``∀ x y, x + y = y + x``. So to instantiate it to ``s + t = t + s``, you write ``add_comm s t``. Using these axioms, here is the calculation above rendered in Lean, as a theorem about the integers:

.. code-block:: lean

   import data.int.basic

   -- BEGIN
   example (x y z : int) : (x + y) + z = (x + z) + y :=
   calc
      (x + y) + z = x + (y + z) : add_assoc x y z
              ... = x + (z + y) : eq.subst (add_comm y z) rfl
              ... = (x + z) + y : eq.symm (add_assoc x z y)
   -- END

Using ``rewrite`` is more efficient, though at times we have to provide information to specify where the rules are used:

.. code-block:: lean

    import data.int.basic

    -- BEGIN
    example (x y z : int) : (x + y) + z = (x + z) + y :=
    calc
      (x + y) + z = x + (y + z) : by rw add_assoc
              ... = x + (z + y) : by rw [add_comm y z]
              ... = (x + z) + y : by rw add_assoc
    -- END

In that case, we can use a single ``rewrite``:

.. code-block:: lean

   import data.int.basic

   -- BEGIN
   example (x y z : int) : (x + y) + z = (x + z) + y :=
   by rw [add_assoc, add_comm y z, add_assoc]
   -- END

If you #check the proof before the sequence of ``rewrites`` is sufficient, the error message will display the remaining goal.

Here is another example:

.. code-block:: lean

    import data.int.basic

    -- BEGIN
    variables a b d c : int

    example : (a + b) * (c + d) = a * c + b * c + a * d + b * d :=
    calc
      (a + b) * (c + d) = (a + b) * c + (a + b) * d : by rw left_distrib
        ... = (a * c + b * c) + (a + b) * d         : by rw right_distrib
        ... = (a * c + b * c) + (a * d + b * d)     : by rw right_distrib
        ... = a * c + b * c + a * d + b * d         : by rw ←add_assoc
    -- END

Once again, we can get by with a shorter proof:

.. code-block:: lean

    import data.int.basic

    variables a b d c : int

    -- BEGIN
    example : (a + b) * (c + d) = a * c + b * c + a * d + b * d :=
    by rw [left_distrib, right_distrib, right_distrib, ←add_assoc]
    -- END
