Propositional Logic in Lean
===========================

In this chapter, you will learn how to write proofs in Lean. We will start with a purely mechanical translation that will enable you to represent any natural deduction proof in Lean. We will see, however, that such a style of writing proofs is not very intuitive, nor does it yield very readable proofs. It also does not scale well.

We will then consider some mechanisms that Lean offers that support a more forward-directed style of argumentation. Since these proofs look more like informal proofs but can be directly translated to natural deduction, they will help us understand the relationship between the two.

Expressions for Propositions and Proofs
---------------------------------------

At its core, Lean is what is known as a *type checker*. This means that we can write expressions and ask the system to check that they are well formed, and also ask the system to tell us what type of object they denote. Try this:

.. code-block:: lean

    variables A B C : Prop

    #check A ∧ ¬ B → C

In the online version of this text, you can press the "try it!" button to copy the example to an editor window, and then hover over the markers on the text to read the messages.

In the example, we declare three variables ranging over propositions, and ask Lean to check the expression ``A ∧ ¬ B → C``. The output of the ``#check`` command is ``A ∧ ¬ B → C : Prop``, which asserts that ``A ∧ ¬ B → C`` is of type ``Prop``. In Lean, every well-formed expression has a type.

The logical connectives are rendered in unicode. The following chart shows you how you can type these symbols in the editor, and also provides ascii equivalents, for the purists among you.

+-----------+-------------------+---------------------------------+
| Unicode   | Ascii             | Lean input                      |
+-----------+-------------------+---------------------------------+
|           | true              |                                 |
+-----------+-------------------+---------------------------------+
|           | false             |                                 |

+-----------+-------------------+---------------------------------+
| ∀         | forall            | ``\all``                        |

+-----------+-------------------+---------------------------------+
| λ         | fun               | ``\lam``, ``\fun``              |
+-----------+-------------------+---------------------------------+
| ≠         | ~=                | ``\ne``                         |
+-----------+-------------------+---------------------------------+

So far, we have only talked about the first seven items on the list. We will discuss the quantifiers, lambda, and equality later. Try typing some expressions and checking them on your own. You should try changing one of the variables in the example above to ``D``, or inserting a nonsense symbol into the expression, and take a look at the error message that Lean returns.

In addition to declaring variables, if ``P`` is any expression of type ``Prop``, we can declare the hypothesis that ``P`` is true:

.. code-block:: lean

    variables A B : Prop
    variable  h : A ∧ ¬ B

    #check h

Formally, what is going on is that any proposition can be viewed as a type, namely, the type of proofs of that proposition. A hypothesis, or premise, is just a variable of that type. Building proofs is then a matter of writing down expressions of the correct type. For example, if ``P`` is any expression of type ``A ∧ B``, then ``and.left P`` is an expression of type ``A``, and ``and.right P`` is an expression of type ``B``. In other words, if ``P`` is a proof of ``A ∧ B``, and ``and.left P`` is a name for the proof you get by applying the left elimination rule for and:

.. raw:: html

   <img src="_static/propositional_logic_in_lean.1.png">

.. raw:: latex

   \begin{center}
   \AXM{\vdots}
   \noLine
   \UIM{P}
   \noLine
   \UIM{\vdots}
   \noLine
   \UIM{A \wedge B}
   \UIM{A}
   \DP
   \end{center}

Similarly, ``and.right P`` is the proof of ``B`` you get by applying the right elimination rule. So, continuing the example above, we can write

.. code-block:: lean

    variables A B : Prop
    variable h : A ∧ ¬ B

    #check and.left h
    #check and.right h

The two expressions represent, respectively, these two proofs:

.. raw:: html

   <img src="_static/propositional_logic_in_lean.2.png">

.. raw:: latex

   \begin{center}
   \AXM{}
   \RLM{h}
   \UIM{A \wedge \neg B}
   \UIM{A}
   \DP
   \quad\quad
   \AXM{}
   \RLM{h}
   \UIM{A \wedge \neg B}
   \UIM{\neg B}
   \DP
   \end{center}

Notice that in this way of representing natural deduction proofs, there are no "free floating" hypotheses. Every hypothesis has a label. In Lean, we will typically use expressions like ``h``, ``h1``, ``h2``, ... to label hypotheses, but you can use any identifier you want.

If ``h1`` is a proof of ``A`` and ``h2`` is a proof of ``B``, then ``and.intro h1 h2`` is a proof of ``A ∧ B``. So we can continue the example above:

.. code-block:: lean

    variables A B : Prop
    variable h : A ∧ ¬ B

    #check and.intro (and.right h) (and.left h)

This corresponds to the following proof:

.. raw:: html

   <img src="_static/propositional_logic_in_lean.2b.png">

.. raw:: latex

   \begin{center}
   \AXM{}
   \RLM{h}
   \UIM{A \wedge \neg B}
   \UIM{\neg B}
   \AXM{}
   \RLM{h}
   \UIM{A \wedge \neg B}
   \UIM{A}
   \BIM{\neg B \wedge A}
   \DP
   \end{center}

What about implication? The elimination rule is easy: if ``P₁`` is a proof of ``A → B`` and ``P₂`` is a proof of ``A`` then ``P₁ P₂`` is a proof of ``B``. Notice that we do not even need to name the rule: you just write ``P₁`` followed by ``P₂``, as though you are applying the first to the second. If ``P₁`` and ``P₂`` are compound expressions, put parentheses around them to make it clear where each one begins and ends.

.. code-block:: lean

    variables A B C D : Prop

    variable h1 : A → (B → C)
    variable h2 : D → A
    variable h3 : D
    variable h4 : B

    #check h2 h3
    #check h1 (h2 h3)
    #check (h1 (h2 h3)) h4

Lean adopts the convention that applications associate to the left, so that an expression ``h1 h2 h3`` is interpreted as ``(h1 h2) h3``. Implications associate to the *right*, so that ``A → B → C`` is interpreted as ``A → (B → C)``. This may seem funny, but it is a convenient way to represent implications that take multiple hypotheses, since an expression ``A → B → C → D → E`` means that ``E`` follows from ``A``, ``B``, ``C``, and ``D``. So the example above could be written as follows:

.. code-block:: lean

    variables A B C D : Prop

    variable h1 : A → B → C
    variable h2 : D → A
    variable h3 : D
    variable h4 : B

    #check h2 h3
    #check h1 (h2 h3)
    #check h1 (h2 h3) h4

Notice that parentheses are still needed in the expression ``h1 (h2 h3)``.

The implication introduction rule is the tricky one, because it can cancel a hypothesis. In terms of Lean expressions, the rule translates as follows. Suppose ``A`` and ``B`` have type ``Prop``, and, assuming ``h`` is the premise that ``A`` holds, ``P`` is proof of ``B``, possibly involving ``h``. Then the expression ``assume h : A, P`` is a proof of ``A → B``. For example, we can construct a proof of ``A → A ∧ A`` as follows:

.. code-block:: lean

    variable A : Prop

    #check (assume h : A, and.intro h h)

Notice that we no longer have to declare ``A`` as a premise. The word ``assume`` makes the premise local to the expression in parentheses, and after the assumption is made, we can refer to ``h``. Given the assumption ``h : A``, ``and.intro h h`` is a proof of ``A ∧ A``, and so the expression ``assume h : A, and.intro h h`` is a proof of ``A → A ∧ A``. In this case, we could leave out the parentheses because the expression is unambiguous:

.. code-block:: lean

    variable A : Prop

    #check assume h : A, and.intro h h

Above, we proved ``¬ B ∧ A`` from the premise ``A ∧ ¬ B``. We can instead obtain a proof of ``A ∧ ¬ B → ¬ B ∧ A`` as follows:

.. code-block:: lean

    variables A B : Prop
    #check (assume h : A ∧ ¬ B, and.intro (and.right h) (and.left h))

All we did was move the premise into a local ``assume``.

(By the way, the ``assume`` command is just alternative syntax for the lambda symbol, so we could also have written this:

.. code-block:: lean

    variables A B : Prop
    #check (λ h : A ∧ ¬ B, and.intro (and.right h) (and.left h))

You will learn more about the lambda symbol later.)

More commands
-------------

Let us introduce a new Lean command, ``example``. This command tells Lean that you are about to prove a theorem, or, more generally, write down an expression of the given type. It should then be followed by the proof or expression itself.

.. code-block:: lean

    variables A B : Prop

    example : A ∧ ¬ B → ¬ B ∧ A :=
    assume h : A ∧ ¬ B,
    and.intro (and.right h) (and.left h)

When given this command, Lean checks the expression after the ``:=`` and makes sure it has the right type. If so, it accepts the expression as a valid proof. If not, it raises an error.

Because the ``example`` command provides information as to the type of the expression that follows (in this case, the proposition being proved), it sometimes enables us to omit other information. For example, we can leave off the type of the assumption:

.. code-block:: lean

    variables A B : Prop

    example : A ∧ ¬ B → ¬ B ∧ A :=
    assume h,
    and.intro (and.right h) (and.left h)

Because Lean knows we are trying to prove an implication with premise ``A ∧ ¬ B``, it can infer that when we write ``assume h``, the identifier ``h`` labels the assumption ``A ∧ ¬ B``.

We can also go in the other direction, and provide the system with *more* information, with the word ``show``. If ``A`` is a proposition and ``P`` is a proof, the expression "``show A, from P``" means the same thing as ``P`` alone, but it signals the intention that ``P`` is a proof of ``A``. When Lean checks this expression, it confirms that ``P`` really is a proof of ``A``, before parsing the expression surrounding it. So, in our example, we could also write:

.. code-block:: lean

    variables A B : Prop

    example : A ∧ ¬ B → ¬ B ∧ A :=
    assume h : A ∧ ¬ B,
    show ¬ B ∧ A, from and.intro (and.right h) (and.left h)

We could even annotate the smaller expressions ``and.right h`` and ``and.left h``, as follows:

.. code-block:: lean

    variables A B : Prop

    example : A ∧ ¬ B → ¬ B ∧ A :=
    assume h : A ∧ ¬ B,
    show ¬ B ∧ A, from and.intro
      (show ¬ B, from and.right h)
      (show A, from and.left h)

This is a good place to mention that Lean generally ignores whitespace, like indentation and returns. We could have written the entire example on a single line. In general, we will adopt conventions for indentation and line breaks that show the structure of proofs and make them easier to read.

Although in the examples above the ``show`` commands were not necessary, there are a number of good reasons to use this style. First, and perhaps most importantly, it makes the proofs easier for us humans to read. Second, it makes the proofs easier to *write*: if you make a mistake in a proof, it is easier for Lean to figure out where you went wrong and provide a meaningful error message if you make your intentions clear. Finally, proving information in the ``show`` clause often makes it possible for you to omit information in other places, since Lean can infer that information from your stated intentions.

There are notational variants. Rather than declare variables and premises beforehand, you can also present them as "arguments" to the example, followed by a colon:

.. code-block:: lean

    example (A B : Prop) : A ∧ ¬ B → ¬ B ∧ A :=
    assume h : A ∧ ¬ B,
    show ¬ B ∧ A, from and.intro (and.right h) (and.left h)

There are two more tricks that can help you write proofs in Lean. The first is using ``sorry``, which is a magical term in Lean which provides a proof of anything at all. It is also known as "cheating." But cheating can help you construct legitimate proofs incrementally: if Lean accepts a proof with ``sorry``'s, the parts of the proof you have written so far have passed Lean's checks for correctness. All you need to do is replace each ``sorry`` with a real proof to complete the task.

.. code-block:: lean

    variables A B : Prop

    example : A ∧ ¬ B → ¬ B ∧ A :=
    assume h, sorry

    example : A ∧ ¬ B → ¬ B ∧ A :=
    assume h, and.intro sorry sorry

    example : A ∧ ¬ B → ¬ B ∧ A :=
    assume h, and.intro (and.right h) sorry

    example : A ∧ ¬ B → ¬ B ∧ A :=
    assume h, and.intro (and.right h) (and.left h)

The second trick is the use of *placeholders*, represented by the underscore symbol. When you write an underscore in an expression, you are asking the system to try to fill in the value for you. This falls short of calling full-blown automation to prove a theorem; rather, you are asking Lean to infer the value from the context. If you use an underscore where a proof should be, Lean typically will *not* fill in the proof, but it will give you an error message that tells you what is missing. This will help you write proof terms incrementally, in a backward-driven fashion. In the example above, try replacing each ``sorry`` by an underscore, ``_``, and take a look at the resulting error messages. In each case, the error tells you what needs to be filled in, and the variables and hypotheses that are available to you at that stage.

One more tip: if you want to delimit the scope of variables or premises introduced with the ``variables`` command, put them in a block that begins with the word ``section`` and ends with the word ``end``. We will use this mechanism below.

Building Natural Deduction Proofs
---------------------------------

In this section, we describe a mechanical translation from natural deduction proofs, by giving a translation for each natural deduction rule. We have already seen some of the correspondences, but we repeat them all here, for completeness.

Implication
~~~~~~~~~~~

We have already explained that implication introduction is implemented with ``assume``, and implication elimination is written as application.

.. code-block:: lean

    variables A B : Prop

    example : A → B :=
    assume h : A,
    show B, from sorry

    section
      variable h1 : A → B
      variable h2 : A

      example : B := h1 h2
    end

Since every example begins by declaring the necessary propositional variables, we will henceforth suppress that declaration in the text.

Conjunction
~~~~~~~~~~~

We have already seen that and-introduction is implemented with ``and.intro``, and the elimination rules are ``and.left`` and ``and.right``.

.. code-block:: lean

    variables A B : Prop

    -- BEGIN
    section
      variables (h1 : A) (h2 : B)

      example : A ∧ B := and.intro h1 h2
    end

    section
      variable h : A ∧ B

      example : A := and.left h
      example : B := and.right h
    end
    -- END

Disjunction
~~~~~~~~~~~

The or-introduction rules are given by ``or.inl`` and ``or.inr``.

.. code-block:: lean

    variables A B : Prop

    -- BEGIN
    section
      variable h : A

      example : A ∨ B := or.inl h
    end

    section
      variable h : B

      example : A ∨ B := or.inr h
    end
    -- END

The elimination rule is the tricky one. To prove ``C`` from ``A ∨ B``, you need three arguments: a proof ``h`` of ``A ∨ B``, a proof of ``C`` from ``A``, and a proof of ``C`` from ``B``. Using line breaks and indentation to highlight the structure as a proof by cases, we can write it with the following form:

.. code-block:: lean

    variables A B C : Prop

    -- BEGIN
    section
      variable h : A ∨ B
      variables (ha : A → C) (hb : B → C)
      example : C :=
      or.elim h
        (assume h1 : A,
          show C, from ha h1)
        (assume h1 : B,
          show C, from hb h1)
    end
    -- END

Notice that we can reuse the label ``h1`` in each branch, since, conceptually, the two branches are disjoint.

Negation
~~~~~~~~

Internally, negation ``¬ A`` is defined by ``A → false``, which you can think of as saying that ``A`` implies something impossible. The rules for negation are therefore similar to the rules for implication. To prove ``¬ A``, assume ``A`` and derive a contradiction.

.. code-block:: lean

    variable A : Prop

    -- BEGIN
    section
      example : ¬ A :=
      assume h : A,
      show false, from sorry
    end
    -- END

If you have proved a negation ``¬ A``, you can get a contradiction by applying it to a proof of ``A``.

.. code-block:: lean

    variable A : Prop

    -- BEGIN
    section
      variable h1 : ¬ A
      variable h2 : A

      example : false := h1 h2
    end
    -- END

Truth and falsity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The *ex falso* rule is called ``false.elim``:

.. code-block:: lean

    variables A : Prop

    -- BEGIN
    section
      variable h : false

      example : A := false.elim h
    end
    -- END

There isn't much to say about ``true`` beyond the fact that it is trivially true:

.. code-block:: lean

    example : true := trivial

Bi-implication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The introduction rule for "if and only if" is ``iff.intro``.

.. code-block:: lean

    variables A B : Prop

    -- BEGIN
    example : A ↔ B :=
    iff.intro
      (assume h : A,
        show B, from sorry)
      (assume h : B,
        show A, from sorry)
    -- END

As usual, we have chosen indentation to make the structure clear. Notice that the same label, ``h``, can be used on both branches, with a different meaning in each, because the scope of an ``assume`` is limited to the expression in which it appears.

The elimination rules are ``iff.elim_left`` and ``iff.elim_right``:

.. code-block:: lean

    variables A B : Prop

    -- BEGIN
    section
      variable h1 : A ↔ B
      variable h2 : A

      example : B := iff.elim_left h1 h2
    end

    section
      variable h1 : A ↔ B
      variable h2 : B

      example : A := iff.elim_right h1 h2
    end
    -- END

Lean recognizes the abbreviation ``iff.mp`` for ``iff.elim_left``, where "mp" stands for "modus ponens". Similarly, you can use ``iff.mpr``, for "modus ponens reverse", instead of ``iff.elim_right``.

Reductio ad absurdum (proof by contradiction)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Finally, there is the rule for proof by contradiction, which we will discuss in greater detail in :numref:`Chapter %s <classical_reasoning>`. It is included for completeness here.

The rule is called ``by_contradiction``. It has one argument, which is a proof of ``false`` from ``¬ A``. To use the rule, you have to ask Lean to allow classical reasoning, by writing ``open classical``. You can do this at the beginning of the file, or any time before using it. If you say ``open classical`` in a section, it will remain in scope for that section.

.. code-block:: lean

    variables A : Prop

    -- BEGIN
    section
      open classical

      example : A :=
      by_contradiction
        (assume h : ¬ A,
          show false, from sorry)
    end
    -- END

Examples
~~~~~~~~

In the last chapter, we constructed the following proof of :math:`A \to C` from :math:`A \to B` and :math:`B \to C`:

.. raw:: html

   <img src="_static/propositional_logic_in_lean.3.png">

.. raw:: latex

   \begin{center}
   \AXM{}
   \RLM{1}
   \UIM{A}
   \AXM{A \to B}
   \BIM{B}
   \AXM{B \to C}
   \BIM{C}
   \RLM{1}
   \UIM{A \to C}
   \DP
   \end{center}

We can model this in Lean as follows:

.. code-block:: lean

    variables A B C : Prop

    variable h1 : A → B
    variable h2 : B → C

    example : A → C :=
    assume h : A,
    show C, from h2 (h1 h)

Notice that the hypotheses in the natural deduction proof that are not canceled are declared as variables in the Lean version.

We also constructed the following proof:

.. raw:: html

   <img src="_static/propositional_logic_in_lean.4.png">

.. raw:: latex

   \begin{center}
   \AXM{}
   \RLM{2}
   \UIM{A \to (B \to C)}
   \AXM{}
   \RLM{1}
   \UIM{A \wedge B}
   \UIM{A}
   \BIM{B \to C}
   \AXM{}
   \RLM{1}
   \UIM{A \wedge B}
   \UIM{B}
   \BIM{C}
   \RLM{1}
   \UIM{A \wedge B \to C}
   \RLM{2}
   \UIM{(A \to (B \to C)) \to (A \wedge B \to C)}
   \DP
   \end{center}

Here is how it is written in Lean:

.. code-block:: lean

    example (A B C : Prop) : (A → (B → C)) → (A ∧ B → C) :=
    assume h1 : A → (B → C),
    assume h2 : A ∧ B,
    show C, from h1 (and.left h2) (and.right h2)

This works because ``and.left h2`` is a proof of ``A``, and ``and.right h2`` is a proof of ``B``.

Finally, we constructed the following proof of :math:`A \wedge (B \vee C) \to (A \wedge B) \vee (A \wedge C)`:

.. raw:: html

   <img src="_static/propositional_logic_in_lean.5.png">

.. raw:: latex

   \begin{center}
   \AXM{}
   \RLM{2}
   \UIM{A \wedge (B \vee C)}
   \UIM{B \vee C}

   \RLM{2}
   \UIM{A \wedge (B \vee C)}
   \UIM{A}
   \AXM{}
   \RLM{1}
   \UIM{B}
   \BIM{A \wedge B}
   \UIM{(A \wedge B) \vee (A \wedge C)}
   \AXM{}
   \RLM{2}
   \UIM{A \wedge (B \vee C)}
   \UIM{A}
   \AXM{}
   \RLM{1}
   \UIM{C}
   \BIM{A \wedge C}
   \UIM{(A \wedge B) \vee (A \wedge C)}
   \RLM{1}
   \TIM{(A \wedge B) \vee (A \wedge C)}
   \RLM{2}
   \UIM{(A \wedge (B \vee C)) \to ((A \wedge B) \vee
     (A \wedge C))}
   \DP
   \end{center}

Here is a version in Lean:

.. code-block:: lean

    example (A B C : Prop) : A ∧ (B ∨ C) → (A ∧ B) ∨ (A ∧ C) :=
    assume h1 : A ∧ (B ∨ C),
    or.elim (and.right h1)
      (assume h2 : B,
        show (A ∧ B) ∨ (A ∧ C),
          from or.inl (and.intro (and.left h1) h2))
      (assume h2 : C,
        show (A ∧ B) ∨ (A ∧ C),
          from or.inr (and.intro (and.left h1) h2))

In fact, bearing in mind that ``assume`` is alternative syntax for the symbol ``λ``, and that Lean can often infer the type of an assumption, we can make the proof remarkably brief:

.. code-block:: lean

    example (A B C : Prop) : A ∧ (B ∨ C) → (A ∧ B) ∨ (A ∧ C) :=
    λ h1, or.elim (and.right h1)
      (λ h2, or.inl (and.intro (and.left h1) h2))
      (λ h2, or.inr (and.intro (and.left h1) h2))

The proof is cryptic, though. Using such a style makes proofs hard to write, read, understand, maintain, and debug. In the next section we will describe a remarkably simple device that makes it much easier to understand what is going on.

Forward Reasoning
-----------------

Lean supports forward reasoning by allowing you to write proofs using the ``have`` command.

.. code-block:: lean

    variables A B C : Prop

    variable h1 : A → B
    variable h2 : B → C

    example : A → C :=
    assume h : A,
    have h3 : B, from h1 h,
    show C, from h2 h3

Writing a proof with ``have h : A, from P, ... h ...`` has the same effect as writing ``... P ...``. This ``have`` command checks that ``P`` is a proof of ``A``, and then give you the label ``h`` to use in place of ``P``. Thus the last line of the previous proof can be thought of as abbreviating ``show C, from h2 (h1 h)``, since ``h3`` abbreviates ``h1 h``. Such abbreviations can make a big difference, especially when the proof ``P`` is very long.

There are a number of advantages to using ``have``. For one thing, it makes the proof more readable: the example above states ``B`` explicitly as an auxiliary goal. It can also save repetition: ``h3`` can be used repeatedly after it is introduced, without duplicating the proof. Finally, it makes it easier to construct and debug the proof: stating ``B`` as an auxiliary goal makes it easier for Lean to deliver an informative error message when the goal is not properly met.

In the last section, we considered the following proof:

.. code-block:: lean

    example (A B C : Prop) : (A → (B → C)) → (A ∧ B → C) :=
    assume h1 : A → (B → C),
    assume h2 : A ∧ B,
    show C, from h1 (and.left h2) (and.right h2)

Using ``have``, it can be written more perspicuously as follows:

.. code-block:: lean

    example (A B C : Prop) : (A → (B → C)) → (A ∧ B → C) :=
    assume h1 : A → (B → C),
    assume h2 : A ∧ B,
    have h3 : A, from and.left h2,
    have h4 : B, from and.right h2,
    show C, from h1 h3 h4

We can be even more verbose, and add another line:

.. code-block:: lean

    example (A B C : Prop) : (A → (B → C)) → (A ∧ B → C) :=
    assume h1 : A → (B → C),
    assume h2 : A ∧ B,
    have h3 : A, from and.left h2,
    have h4 : B, from and.right h2,
    have h5 : B → C, from h1 h3,
    show C, from h5 h4

Adding more information doesn't always make a proof more readable; when the individual expressions are small and easy enough to understand, spelling them out in detail can introduce clutter. As you learn to use Lean, you will have to develop your own style, and use your judgment to decide which steps to make explicit.

Here is how some of the basic inferences look, when expanded with ``have``. In the and-introduction rule, it is a matter showing each conjunct first, and then putting them together:

.. code-block:: lean

    example (A B : Prop) : A ∧ B → B ∧ A :=
    assume h1 : A ∧ B,
    have h2 : A, from and.left h1,
    have h3 : B, from and.right h1,
    show B ∧ A, from and.intro h3 h2

Compare that with this version, which instead states first that we will use the ``and.intro`` rule, and then makes the two resulting goals explicit:

.. code-block:: lean

    example (A B : Prop) : A ∧ B → B ∧ A :=
    assume h1 : A ∧ B,
    show B ∧ A, from
      and.intro
        (show B, from and.right h1)
        (show A, from and.left h1)

Once again, at issue is only readability. Lean does just fine with the following short version:

.. code-block:: lean

    example (A B : Prop) : A ∧ B → B ∧ A :=
    λ h, and.intro (and.right h) (and.left h)

When using the or-elimination rule, it is often clearest to state the relevant disjunction explicitly:

.. code-block:: lean

    example (A B C : Prop) : C :=
    have h : A ∨ B, from sorry,
    show C, from or.elim h
      (assume h1 : A,
        show C, from sorry)
      (assume h2 : B,
        show C, from sorry)

Here is a ``have``-structured presentation of an example from the previous section:

.. code-block:: lean

    example (A B C : Prop) : A ∧ (B ∨ C) → (A ∧ B) ∨ (A ∧ C) :=
    assume h1 : A ∧ (B ∨ C),
    have h2 : A, from and.left h1,
    have h3 : B ∨ C, from and.right h1,
    show (A ∧ B) ∨ (A ∧ C), from
      or.elim h3
        (assume h4 : B,
          have h5 : A ∧ B, from and.intro h2 h4,
          show (A ∧ B) ∨ (A ∧ C), from or.inl h5)
        (assume h4 : C,
          have h5 : A ∧ C, from and.intro h2 h4,
          show (A ∧ B) ∨ (A ∧ C), from or.inr h5)


.. _definitions_and_theorems:

Definitions and Theorems
------------------------

Lean allows us to name definitions and theorems for later use. For example, here is a definition of a new "connective":

.. code-block:: lean

    def triple_and (A B C : Prop) : Prop :=
    A ∧ (B ∧ C)

As with the ``example`` command, it does not matter whether the arguments ``A``, ``B``, and ``C`` are declared beforehand with the ``variables`` command, or with the definition itself. We can then apply the definition to any expressions:

.. code-block:: lean

    def triple_and (A B C : Prop) : Prop :=
    A ∧ (B ∧ C)

    -- BEGIN
    variables D E F G : Prop

    #check triple_and (D ∨ E) (¬ F → G) (¬ D)
    -- END

Later, we will see more interesting examples of definitions, like the following function from natural numbers to natural numbers, which doubles its input:

.. code-block:: lean

    def double (n : ℕ) : ℕ := n + n

What is more interesting right now is that Lean also allows us to name theorems, and use them later, as rules of inference. For example, consider the following theorem:

.. code-block:: lean

    theorem and_commute (A B : Prop) : A ∧ B → B ∧ A :=
    assume h, and.intro (and.right h) (and.left h)

Once we have defined it, we can use it freely:

.. code-block:: lean

    theorem and_commute (A B : Prop) : A ∧ B → B ∧ A :=
    assume h, and.intro (and.right h) (and.left h)

    -- BEGIN
    variables C D E : Prop
    variable h1 : C ∧ ¬ D
    variable h2 : ¬ D ∧ C → E

    example : E := h2 (and_commute C (¬ D) h1)
    -- END

It is annoying in this example that we have to give the arguments ``C`` and ``¬ D`` explicitly, because they are implicit in ``h1``. In fact, Lean allows us to tell this to Lean in the definition of ``and_commute``:

.. code-block:: lean

    theorem and_commute {A B : Prop} : A ∧ B → B ∧ A :=
    assume h, and.intro (and.right h) (and.left h)

Here the squiggly braces indicate that the arguments ``A`` and ``B`` are *implicit*, which is to say, Lean should infer them from the context when the theorem is used. We can then write the following instead:

.. code-block:: lean

    theorem and_commute {A B : Prop} : A ∧ B → B ∧ A :=
    assume h, and.intro (and.right h) (and.left h)

    -- BEGIN
    variables C D E : Prop
    variable h1 : C ∧ ¬ D
    variable h2 : ¬ D ∧ C → E

    example : E := h2 (and_commute h1)
    -- END

Indeed, Lean's library has a theorem, ``and_comm``, defined in exactly this way.

By the way, we could avoid the ``assume`` step in the proof of ``and_comm`` by making the hypothesis into an argument:

.. code-block:: lean

    theorem and_commute {A B : Prop} (h : A ∧ B) : B ∧ A :=
    and.intro (and.right h) (and.left h)

The two definitions yield the same result.

Definitions and theorems are important in mathematics; they allow us to build up complex theories from fundamental principles. Lean also accepts the word ``lemma`` instead of ``theorem``.

What is interesting is that in interactive theorem proving, we can even define familiar patterns of inference. For example, all of the following inferences were mentioned in the last chapter:

.. code-block:: lean

    namespace hidden

    variables {A B : Prop}

    theorem or_resolve_left (h1 : A ∨ B) (h2 : ¬ A) : B :=
    or.elim h1
      (assume h3 : A, show B, from false.elim (h2 h3))
      (assume h3 : B, show B, from h3)

    theorem or_resolve_right (h1 : A ∨ B) (h2 : ¬ B) : A :=
    or.elim h1
      (assume h3 : A, show A, from h3)
      (assume h3 : B, show A, from false.elim (h2 h3))

    theorem absurd (h1 : ¬ A) (h2 : A) : B :=
    false.elim (h1 h2)

    end hidden

In fact, Lean's library defines ``or.resolve_left``, ``or.resolve_right``, and ``absurd``. We used the ``namespace`` command to avoid naming conflicts, which would have raised an error.

When we ask you to prove basic facts from propositional logic in Lean, as with propositional logic, our goal is to have you learn how to use Lean's primitives. As a result, for those exercises, you should not use facts from the library. As we move towards real mathematics, however, you can use facts from the library more freely.

Additional Syntax
-----------------

In this section, we describe some extra syntactic features of Lean, for power users. The syntactic gadgets are often convenient, and sometimes make proofs look prettier.

For one thing, you can use subscripted numbers with a backslash. For example, you can write ``h₁`` by typing ``h\1``. The labels are irrelevant to Lean, so the difference is only cosmetic.

Another feature is that you can omit the label in an ``assume`` statement, providing an "anonymous" hypothesis. You can then refer back to the last anonymous assumption using the keyword ``this``:

.. code-block:: lean

    variables A B : Prop

    -- BEGIN
    example : A → A ∨ B :=
    assume : A,
    show A ∨ B, from or.inl this
    -- END

Alternatively, you can refer back to unlabeled assumptions by putting them in French quotes:

.. code-block:: lean

    variables A B : Prop

    -- BEGIN
    example : A → B → A ∧ B :=
    assume : A,
    assume : B,
    show A ∧ B, from and.intro ‹A› ‹B›
    -- END

You can also use the word ``have`` without giving a label, and refer back to them using the same conventions. Here is an example that uses these features:

.. code-block:: lean

    theorem my_theorem {A B C : Prop} :
      A ∧ (B ∨ C) → (A ∧ B) ∨ (A ∧ C) :=
    assume h : A ∧ (B ∨ C),
    have A, from and.left h,
    have B ∨ C, from and.right h,
    show (A ∧ B) ∨ (A ∧ C), from
      or.elim ‹B ∨ C›
        (assume : B,
          have A ∧ B, from and.intro ‹A› ‹B›,
          show (A ∧ B) ∨ (A ∧ C), from or.inl this)
        (assume : C,
          have A ∧ C, from and.intro ‹A› ‹C›,
          show (A ∧ B) ∨ (A ∧ C), from or.inr this)

Another trick is that you can write ``h.left`` and ``h.right`` instead of ``and.left h`` and ``and.right h`` whenever ``h`` is a conjunction, and you can write ``⟨h1, h2⟩`` (using ``\<`` and ``\>``) instead of ``and.intro h1 h2`` whenever Lean can figure out that a conjunction is what you are trying to prove. With these conventions, you can write the following:

.. code-block:: lean

    example (A B : Prop) : A ∧ B → B ∧ A :=
    assume h : A ∧ B,
    show B ∧ A, from ⟨h.right, h.left⟩

This is nothing more than shorthand for the following:

.. code-block:: lean

    example (A B : Prop) : A ∧ B → B ∧ A :=
    assume h : A ∧ B,
    show B ∧ A, from and.intro (and.right h) (and.left h)

Even more concisely, you can write this:

.. code-block:: lean

    example (A B : Prop) : A ∧ B → B ∧ A :=
    assume h, ⟨h.right, h.left⟩

You can even take apart a conjunction with an ``assume``, so that this works:

.. code-block:: lean

    example (A B : Prop) : A ∧ B → B ∧ A :=
    assume ⟨h₁, h₂⟩, ⟨h₂, h₁⟩

Similarly, if ``h`` is a biconditional, you can write ``h.mp`` and ``h.mpr`` instead of ``iff.mp h`` and ``iff.mpr h``, and you can write ``⟨h1, h2⟩`` instead of ``iff.intro h1 h2``. As a result, Lean understands these proofs:

.. code-block:: lean

    example (A B : Prop) : B ∧ (A ↔ B) → A :=
    assume ⟨hB, hAB⟩,
    hAB.mpr hB

    example (A B : Prop) : A ∧ B ↔ B ∧ A :=
    ⟨assume ⟨h₁, h₂⟩, ⟨h₂, h₁⟩, assume ⟨h₁, h₂⟩, ⟨h₂, h₁⟩⟩

Finally, you can add comments to your proofs in two ways. First, any text after a double-dash ``--`` until the end of a line is ignored by the Lean processor. Second, any text between ``/-`` and ``-/`` denotes a block comment, and is also ignored. You can nest block comments.

.. code-block:: lean

    /- This is a block comment.
       It can fill multiple lines. -/

    example (A : Prop) : A → A :=
    assume : A,        -- assume the antecedent
    show A, from this  -- use it to establish the conclusion
